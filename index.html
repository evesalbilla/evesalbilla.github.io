<p style ="color:white;text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;"> 
  I am a first year student at the University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business studying International Business with a minor in Business & Public Policy and a certificate in Business Spanish. Language and culture are huge passions of mine and I currently speak Spanish, Tagalog, and German along with English. I hope to be able to learn more languages in the future! My favorite foods are sushi and gyros, my favorite color is canery yellow (but it clashes with my skin tone so I can't wear it), and my favorite genre of music is RnB. In the future I hope to become an international civil rights attorney.
